# Graphics Quality Settings

**Reading this chapter takes about 10 minutes.**

This chapter describes how to set the graphics quality in the Editor.

## Why Set Graphics Quality?

- When players launch a game, the system will **automatically** detect the player device's hardware and select the appropriate graphics quality level.
- In the editor, developers can set the graphics quality of the main viewport and running viewport, so that they can **simulate and preview** the display of assets and scenes under different levels of image quality when developing games.

## How to Set the Graphics Quality in the Editor?

- **Step.1**
  -  Click the [Project] button on the far left side of the Editor menu bar and find [Editor Settings] in the dropdown menu.

- **Step.3**
  -  Click on the [GPU Performance Level] dropdown menu, and select the graphics quality level you want to set for the **main viewport** and the **test-running viewport**. The higher the level, the better the quality, with Level 1 being the lowest level and Film Quality being the highest level. The default image quality is Film Quality.
